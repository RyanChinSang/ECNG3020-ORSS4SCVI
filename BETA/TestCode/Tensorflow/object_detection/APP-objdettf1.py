# # Object Detection Demo
# Welcome to the object detection inference walkthrough!
# This notebook will walk you step by step through the process of using a pre-trained model to detect objects in an
# image.
# Make sure to follow the [installation instructions]
# (https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md) before you start.

# # Model preparation
# ## Variables
#
# Any model exported using the `export_inference_graph.py` tool can be loaded here simply by changing `PATH_TO_CKPT`
# to point to a new .pb file.
#
# By default we use an "SSD with Mobilenet" model here. See the [detection model zoo]
# (https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md)
# for a list of other models that can be run out-of-the-box with varying speeds and accuracies.
# What model to download.

# Path to frozen detection graph. This is the actual model that is used for the object detection.
