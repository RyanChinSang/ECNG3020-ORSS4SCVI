_________________________________________________[DESCRIPTION]__________________________________________________________
This file is the primary reference of what tasks/objectives need to be done. It may highlight any change possible that 
needs, or is desired to be changed. All changes should, if implemented, impact positively to the project.

_________________________________________________[INFORMATION]__________________________________________________________
Dates:
All dates are in the format: dd.mm.yyyy

Ranks:
HIGH  : If accomplished would contribute very meaningfully to the project's core progress with regards to the required
        deliverables of ECNG3020. These are usually challenging to accomplish.
MEDIUM: If accomplished would make the program more informative and user-friendly.
LOW   : If accomplished would add more meaning to either, or, both of programming documentation and/or presentation.

3. Catch-up and organize all documentation:
   a. Project Report
   b. Reading:
      i. Scholarly research Papers
     ii. Articles
    iii. Online documentation
     vi. Online discussions; Journals, Forums, Blogs
   c. VERSION.txt
      i. Log all history
     ii. See TODO[LOW]#2
4. Speed Up operation of ORSS4SCVI (DDL: v1.0a) - 30fps operation, minimum
5. Port app to Android App (Mobile) with full functionality (BIG) (RES) (DDL: v1.0a)
6. Add more/finish Tutorials/learning in Python; (BIG) (RES) (DDL: v1.0a)
   a. multiprocessing(WIP) (DDL: v0.3a)
      NB1: REF: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3044580/multiprocessing-vs-threading-python?rq=1
   c. Tensorflow (WIP) (RES) (DDL: v0.3a)
      i. Learn how the TensorFlow performs recognition properly
     ii. Learn models
         A. How, What, Why they work?
         B. How to train a custom model?
         C. How to create a custom model? Should a custom model be created? Why?
         D. What is COCO dataset?
    iii. Investigate Speech Recognition as accomplished through GTF's demo Android app.
7. Research all modules more, and give/have/document solid reasons for choosing them (DDL: v1.0a)
   a. pyttsx3 vs. gTTS
   b. Google TensorFLow (See TODO[High]#6.c.)
   c. SpeechRecognition (Online vs. Offline)
8. Implement OCR features (DDL: v1.5a)
9. Add interpretation of number of detected objects (DDL: 0.4a)
   a. Say the name of the object
   b. Say number of name of object
      i. [t2s] "crowded" if there are more than 3* persons detected in frame
         NB1: the actual number of this needs revision/calibration
         NB2: the frequency at which the t2s action is taken needs revision/calibration

[MEDIUM]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Find accurate ways to generalize constants' values (WIP)
7. Add interrupt functionality for new t2s instances - prevents delay in tts
9. Add more colours to 'colours_dict' in ColourID (DDL: v0.3a)


[LOW]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Make Better README.md; Progress, Description, Purpose etc. (WIP)
2. Use a better platform for documenting (RES) (DDL: v1.0a)
4.


__________________________________________________[COMPLETED]___________________________________________________________
All completed tasks\objectives go in this section, according to Rank, then by date.
All completed task\objectives must work as desired to qualify in this section.

[HIGH]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[#1 - 08.11.2017; dev01 and v0.1a Stable released with full [Online] functionality]
1. Start actual dev0.1a; discuss features based on research and discussion with lecturer
   a. Make a multiprocessing python script that run openCV video stream and also looks out for keystrokes without delay
   b. Turn keystrokes into a voice listening script
   c. Alike to Base\VoiceRecg\APP-SpchRecg - add online connectivity check to select modes [Voice/Keystrokes] and
      chooses which SR to use [Google/Sphinx]

[#6(b,d,e) - 08.11.2017]
6. Add more/finish Tutorials/learning in Python;
   b. SpeechRecognition
   d. OpenCV
   e. TextToSpeech

[#2 - 09.11.2017]
2. Merge all TODO.txt documents into this one, AND clean up old TODO.txt files.

[#6(a[/],f{i,ii[x'd]}) - 30.11.2017]
6. Add more/finish Tutorials/learning in Python;
   a. threading (DDL: v0.2a)
   NB1: This got \ - the objective was half complete of a whole (multiprocessing was not looked at extensively)
   f. ColorID (DDL: v0.2a)
      i. Port ColorID operation into it's own python file
     ii. Implement towards a class? (RES)
         NB1: This got x'd - making this into a class proved to be unnecessary


[MEDIUM]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[#(5, 6) - 15.11.2017]
5- Store mpl's default dpi into memory via a variable to use in setting figsize (small speedup) (DDL: v0.2a)
6- Add fps native to VideoStream

[#(1, 2[~~], 4, 8[+1'd]) - 30.11.2017]
1. Fix weird behaviour when screenshot is taken, the mpl window resizes to default size. (DDL: v0.2a)
REF: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/8736
2- Add better offline/online operation; check/initialize if internet() as True/False (DDL: v0.2a)
   a. Offline:
      i. Use keyboard/manual input only
     ii. Do not check for online (faster) - unless user uses specific input to do an online check
         a. This check with call internet() again and re-set the global var
    iii. Use sphinx offline speech2text on keypress (may remove / change to always offline listen / make configurable)
   b. Online:
      i. Use microphone to listen at all times using google, which updates a global var to call different functions
   NB1: This got ~~ - it's functionality is approximately as initially planned (stable and sufficient)
4- Make own expanded list of colours and values based on webcolors' dictionary (RES) (DDL: v0.2a)
8- Add numpy calculation to colorID calculations (small speedup) (DDL: v0.2a)
   NB1: This got +1'd - it's functionality in the end turned out better than initially planned.

[#10 - 16.12.2017]
10. Fix the mysterious 132-pixel vertical elongation. (DDL: v0.4a)
    NB1: This is actually "treating the symptoms" instead of "finding the cure"

[LOW]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[#3 - 15.11.2017]
3. Add description in this file.
